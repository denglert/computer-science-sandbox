## Problem

The country of England is antiquated enough to still rely on material tokens for currency. This is
made up of pounds, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

How many different ways can £5 be made, using any number of coins?
