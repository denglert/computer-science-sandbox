# Coin change problems


**Variations:**

- [Find the minimum amount of coins needed for a given amount](./minimum_number_of_coins)
    - Possible solution methods:
        - Dynamic programming
        - Greedy (optimal if the coin system is [canonical][canonical_coin_system])
		- Recursive


- [Find the number of possible combination to break an amount](./number_of_combinations)
    - Possible solution methods:
        - Dynamic programming
		- Recursive
