# Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. 

It refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a
recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span
several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem
can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal
solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure. 


Examples:
- Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem
- Fibonacci sequence
- A type of balanced 0â€“1 matrix
- ...
