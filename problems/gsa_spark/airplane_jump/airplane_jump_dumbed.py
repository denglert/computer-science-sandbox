"""
Realising he would never know his hash-tables from his hat-stand, Bob got tired
of programming and decided to get a much more appropriate job as skydiving
instructor.

To his dismay, on his first day at work, he is presented with a maths problem.
 
Imagine that N humans are in the queue for a skydiving jump, naively placing
their lives in Bobâ€™s incapable hands.

Every second, one of two possibilities occurs:

- The first human in the queue jumps from the aeroplane, with probability P
- The first human in the queue hesitates, making the other humans in the queue
wait, with probability (1 - P)

The i-th human in the queue cannot jump from the aeroplane until all humans
with indices 1 to (i - 1) have made the jump. Only one human can make the jump
each second.

Bob needs to calculate the expected value of the number of humans that have
jumped after T seconds.

Firmly aware of his own inadequacy pertaining to calculations of any kind, Bob
has come to you for help.

Compute the expected value of the number of humans that have jumped after t
seconds for N = 40, t = 20, P = 0.7.
